===============

Start with the configuration:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   source/config
  
You can run the code by typing::

	$ python runme.py
	
``runme.py`` calls the main functions of the code, which are explained in the following sections.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   source/generate_models
   source/initialization
   source/input_maps
   

Helping functions for the models are included in ``helping_functions.py``.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   source/generate_intermediate_files
   source/correction_functions
   source/spatial_functions
   
Utility functions as well as imported libraries are included in ``util.py``.
